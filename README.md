# Encrpytion & Decrpytion program
### Kyeongsoo Kim, September 2017 ~ November 2017



This program translates Unicode files between UTF-8, UTF-16LE, and UTF-16BE formats.

- UTF-8 to UTF16BE
- UTF-8 to UTF16LE
- UTF-16LE to UTF-8
- UTF-16BE to UTF-8

 The concept of the project is designed by Prof. Stark in Stony Brook University, However all the actual code except base header file is made by me.
